# WildBootTests.jl

This package performs wild bootstrap-based hypothesis tests at extreme speed. It is intended mainly for linear models: OLS and IV/2SLS. For an introduction to the wild bootstrap and the algorithms deployed here see [Roodman et al. (2019)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1536867X19830877?journalCode=stja)
